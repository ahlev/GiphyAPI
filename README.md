# GiphyAPI

These files create a web application that uses buttons to search for 10 gifs at a time from the Giphy API, using ajax calls.

Users have the option to enter text and create their own buttons, which can then be used to search for gifs.

Gifs display as static images first, with animation that toggles on image-click. Hovering over a gif maginfies it somewhat, where it is still clickable to stop / start the animation loop.

Buttons were created dynamically using jQuery and javascript loops. The flexbox CSS framework helped me to style and optmiize some of my elements.
